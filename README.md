# Applied machine-learning for science

💻 Material for a course on applied machine-learning for scientists taught at
EPFL in spring 2018.

# Outline

The course consists of six two hour lectures, followed by one hour to discuss
the week's homework assignment. Followed by a final project on real world data.

* Intro and Model Performance
    * [slides](https://rawgit.com/wildtreetech/advanced-computing-2018/master/index.html?p=lecture1.md) [notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/wildtreetech/advanced-computing-2018/master?filepath=%2Fmaterial%2Flecture-01%2Flecture.ipynb) [exercise](https://github.com/wildtreetech/advanced-computing-2018/blob/master/material/lecture-01/exercise.ipynb)
* Tree based models
* Neural Networks
* Feature engineering
* Embeddings and pretrained networks
* Interpretability


# Run in the cloud

You can run the notebooks from this repository from your browser without
installing anything. To do so click the badge below.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/wildtreetech/advanced-computing-2018/master)

This is good if you want to try out something but mybinder.org makes it a
bit difficult to save your work so I recommend you still install things
locally.


# Technicalities, installing, running code

All the code will be written in python. We will make use of the scientific
python stack:

* python v3.6
* numpy v1.12.1
* scikit-learn v0.19
* keras
* matplotlib v2.x.x
* jupyter

All work submitted for credit has to run with these dependencies only.

[Instructions on installing](install.md) on Windows, mac and linux.
